*Part 1: Modeling Average Latency;
/*
1. Is there improvement in avg latency over time when the patients use an ipad?
	- Scheduled visits only
	- Adjust for age language ability and average accuracy
	- Treat time as continous
	- Compare appropraite models for time (linear, qaudratic, etc.)
	- Compare covariance structure
